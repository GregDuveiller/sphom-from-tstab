# sphom-from-tstab

The name of this repository is an abbreviation of *spatial homogeneity from temporal stability*. This repository contains code to create and analyse an index called the TCI (temporal consistency index) that can be extracted from satellite remote sensing time series of the MODIS instrument. All details are availabled in the following article (in press):
